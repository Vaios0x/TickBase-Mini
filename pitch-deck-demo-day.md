# 🎤 Demo Day Script (2 minutes)

## Opening (15 seconds)
"Imagine paying $500 for concert tickets, only to be turned away at the door because they're fake. This happens to millions of people every year. The ticketing industry loses $5 billion annually to fraud, while scalpers make 10x profits. We're TickBase, and we're fixing this broken system."

## Problem (20 seconds)
"Current ticketing is a disaster. Ticketmaster charges 30% fees. Scalpers use bots to buy everything. Fans get scammed with fake tickets. And there's zero transparency in the resale market. The industry needs disruption, and blockchain is the answer."

## Solution (30 seconds)
"TickBase turns tickets into NFTs on Base. Here's the magic: Zero fraud because every ticket is verifiable on-chain. Fair resale with smart contract rules. And the killer feature - one-click purchases with zero gas fees thanks to Base paymasters. Watch this..."

## Demo (35 seconds)
"[SCREEN SHARE] I'm in Coinbase Wallet. I open TickBase mini app. AI recommends this concert based on my preferences. One click - boom, purchased. No gas fees, no wallet popups. The NFT is instantly in my wallet. I can transfer it, stake it for rewards, or resell it within our rules. This entire flow took 5 seconds."

## Traction (15 seconds)
"In 30 days, we've onboarded 500+ users, listed 50+ events, and processed over $10,000 in tickets with ZERO fraud. We have LOIs from 3 major venues and we're growing 127% month-over-month."

## Business Model (15 seconds)
"We charge just 2.5% per transaction versus Ticketmaster's 30%. Premium features for organizers at $99/month. Enterprise white-label at $999/month. At scale, this is a $100M+ revenue business."

## Team & Ask (15 seconds)
"I'm [Name], previously built and sold [Company]. My co-founder ran ticketing at [Major Venue]. We're raising $500K to reach 10,000 users and $1M in GMV. We're building the onchain Ticketmaster, starting with Base."

## Closing (5 seconds)
"Ticketing is broken. We're the solution. Join us. Questions?"

# 📝 Q&A Preparation

## Likely Questions & Answers:

### Q: "How do you compete with Ticketmaster's monopoly?"
**A:** "We don't compete head-on. We start with crypto and tech events where early adopters want better solutions. As we prove the model, we expand. Ticketmaster was also a startup once - they won by being 10x better. So are we."

### Q: "What about regulatory concerns?"
**A:** "NFT tickets are digital collectibles, similar to trading cards. We're working with legal counsel to ensure compliance. Several states have already passed favorable legislation for blockchain ticketing."

### Q: "How do you prevent ticket scalping?"
**A:** "Smart contracts enforce resale rules set by organizers. They can cap markup percentages, limit transfer frequency, or even disable resale entirely. It's programmatic and transparent."

### Q: "What's your defensibility?"
**A:** "First-mover advantage on Base, exclusive Coinbase Wallet integration, network effects as more events join, and proprietary AI for demand prediction. Plus, switching costs increase as users build their event history."

### Q: "Customer acquisition cost?"
**A:** "Currently $12 CAC with $450 LTV. We acquire users through viral Farcaster frames, organizer referrals, and group purchase incentives. CAC decreases as network effects kick in."

### Q: "Why Base specifically?"
**A:** "Base has 10M+ users through Coinbase, gasless transactions via paymasters, and mini app framework for seamless UX. It's the only chain ready for mainstream consumer apps today."
